🛒 Add to Cart Project
📌 Overview

This is a simple Add to Cart project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It simulates how an e-commerce cart system works — allowing users to add and remove products, while data is stored persistently in localStorage.

🚀 Features

Display a list of products dynamically using JavaScript

Add products to the cart with one click

Remove products from the cart

Cart data stored in localStorage for persistence

Dynamic DOM rendering (real-time UI updates)

Unique ID generation for each added product

🧠 What I Learned

How to manipulate the DOM dynamically

How to store and retrieve data from localStorage

How to use Array methods like .find(), .filter(), and .forEach()

Event handling using addEventListener()

Managing UI re-rendering after state updates

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for basic styling

JavaScript (ES6) – for logic and interactivity

localStorage API – for saving cart data locally

⚙️ How It Works

Products are displayed dynamically from a JavaScript array.

When “Add to Cart” is clicked, the product is added to localStorage and displayed in the cart section.

When “Remove” is clicked, the product is deleted from both the UI and localStorage.

Page refresh doesn’t erase the cart because data is stored persistently.
